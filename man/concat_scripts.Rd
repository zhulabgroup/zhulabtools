\usage{
concat_scripts(
  dir = ".",
  files = NULL,
  pattern = "\\\\.(R|Rmd|qmd)$",
  recursive = TRUE,
  clipboard = TRUE,
  outfile = NULL,
  charset = "UTF-8"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Character. Directory in which to search for files. Ignored if \code{files} is provided. Defaults to current working directory.}

\item{files}{Optional character vector of file paths to concatenate. If \code{NULL} (default), the function will search \code{dir} for files matching \code{pattern}.}

\item{pattern}{Character. Regular expression specifying the file types to include. By default, matches all files ending with \code{.R}, \code{.Rmd}, or \code{.qmd} (case-insensitive).}

\item{recursive}{Logical. Should the file search be recursive in \code{dir}? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{clipboard}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), concatenated output is copied to the system clipboard (macOS/Windows/Linux supported) and no file or console output is produced.}

\item{outfile}{Optional character string specifying a file to which results should be written. Only used if \code{clipboard = FALSE}. If \code{NULL}, output is printed to the console.}

\item{charset}{Character. The text encoding to use when reading files. Default is \code{"UTF-8"}.}
}
\value{
(Invisibly) a character vector containing the concatenated, annotated script text (invisibly).
}
\description{
Concatenate the contents of all \code{.R}, \code{.Rmd}, or \code{.qmd} files either by searching a directory (recursively by default)
or from a specified list of files. Each script is preceded by a header with its relative filename (from the current working directory)
and wrapped in an appropriate code fence for Markdown documents.
}
\details{
By default, output is copied to the system clipboard. If \code{clipboard = TRUE}, no file or console output is produced.
If \code{clipboard = FALSE} and \code{outfile} is supplied, results are written to a file.
Otherwise, results are printed to the console.
