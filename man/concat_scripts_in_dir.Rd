\description{
This function concatenates the contents of all \code{.R} and \code{.qmd} files in a specified directory,
printing each with its filename as a header and wrapping the code in the appropriate code fence (such as \code{r} or \code{qmd}).
Optionally, it writes all combined text to an output file (e.g., Markdown or text file).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Print all R and qmd files in current directory to console
concat_scripts_in_dir()

# Write all scripts from "analysis" folder to an output markdown file
concat_scripts_in_dir(dir = "analysis", output_file = "all_scripts.md")
}
